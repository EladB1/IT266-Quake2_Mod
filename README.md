# IT266-Quake2_Mod
* See the branch named "experimental_branch" for things tried out for fun or done in class.
* See the branch named "project" for modifications made as part of final project.
* Branch master has default source code with two modifications:
  * The blaster bolt is slowed down and it produces an explosion.
  
  
* Final Project Deliverables:
  * Add melee weapons (ideally vary the weapons).
  * Monsters spawn in waves.
  * Difficulty increases based on the skill of the player (will probably be time based).
  * Change the UI.
